## Features

### Elgg Roles

Tutor LMS implements two roles:

* #### Student role 
    * An extension of the standard elgg user role. You don't need to mark users as Students, because Tutor LMS extends this role behavior so that the student is limited to participate in class activities, assignments, etc. 

* #### Teacher role
    * Another extension of the standard elgg user role. Tutor LMS applies permissions to create classrooms, assignments, discussion topics, file uploads, etc., without complex administration. Just select the user account and mark it as a Teacher.
